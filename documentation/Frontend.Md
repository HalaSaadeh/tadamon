# Front-End development of the application, UI, and UX

## Design

### Plans

The nature of the application, being a cruicial application for everyone in need of help, drove us to create a layout that was easy to navigate, and very straightforward. The screens are structured in a way that there wouldn't be any ambiguous travelling back and forth, nor any confusing as to where something is.

### Process

The designs relied on very simplistic modern layouts. Inspired by most applications these days, Tadamon features Bottom Tab Navigation, that can seamlessly switch between three main screens: _Discover_, _Search_, and _Profile_.
